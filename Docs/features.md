- **Action**: Details specific steps taken to achieve objectives
- **Result**: Quantifies outcomes and impacts

#### Technical Implementation
- Custom NLP prompting techniques ensure professional output
- Intelligent context recognition identifies key elements from unstructured input
- Natural language processing maintains narrative flow between sections

### 2. Asynchronous Processing

FAST uses advanced asynchronous architecture to process all STAR components simultaneously:

- **Parallel Generation**: All four STAR components generate concurrently
- **65% Faster**: Compared to traditional sequential processing
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient use of computational resources
